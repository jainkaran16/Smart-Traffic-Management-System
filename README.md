## üß† Overview
This project proposes a **Smart Adaptive Traffic Management System** that dynamically controls traffic signals based on **real-time vehicle density** and **emergency vehicle detection** using **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** and **Arduino-based automation**. It ensures faster movement for ambulances and optimized green light durations for heavy lanes, reducing congestion and improving urban safety‚Äîwhile remaining **low-cost and scalable**.

- Real-time vehicle detection and lane density estimation with **over 90% accuracy**, enabling dynamic signal adjustments to optimize flow.
- **Emergency vehicle prioritization** cut ambulance wait times by **~70%** and boosted green time for high-density lanes by **up to 3.5√ó**.
- **~25% reduction in overall congestion** via dynamic signal allocation, with live outputs driven on **Arduino LED arrays**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

1. **Input:** Live camera feeds from four lanes  
2. **Detection:** YOLO identifies vehicles & ambulances  
3. **Computation:**  
   - Calculates lane density  
   - Applies the adaptive timing formula  
   - Prioritizes lanes with emergency vehicles  
4. **Control:** Arduino adjusts signal LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green) dynamically  

**Green Time Formula**

`GreenTime_i = G_i √ó (1 + D_i/A_i) √ó (1 + Amb) + 0.25 √ó Amb √ó T_amb`
